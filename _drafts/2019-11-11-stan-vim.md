I made a Vim plugin for Stan!

I've been reading and writing a lot of Stan lately, but mainly in barebones text
editors (or even just `cat`ing out the file), so I had none of the creature
comforts of my favorite text editor, Vim.

But I wasn't happy with the syntax highlighting provided by
[existing](https://github.com/maverickg/stan.vim)
[Vim](https://github.com/mdlerch/mc-stan.vim)
[plugins](https://github.com/ssp3nc3r/stan-syntax-vim) (and they also looked out
of date and thinly maintained...), so I went ahead and learnt a truckload of
Vimscript[^1]. Check it out!

[^1]: As it turns out, [Vimscript is a very not good
      language](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/54224o/why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_vimscript/).
      This is probably the last Vim plugin I write.
