In my last post, I introduced the LUPI paradigm and described one algorithm that
interoperates with that paradigm: SVM+. I described LUPI as a up-and-coming
perspective of machine learning that had great potential.

In this short post, I'll describe the results of [one
paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301880839_Simple_and_Efficient_Learning_using_Privileged_Information)
that shows how to implement SVM+ in a simple and efficient way. With this
computational trick, the authors rechristen the algorithm as SVM2+.
