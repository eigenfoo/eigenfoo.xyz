I'm happy to announce that today was my first day at
[Point72](https://www.point72.com/), an American hedge fund, as a data
scientist/research analyst! I'll be working out of their Manhattan office,
powering their internal research efforts.

In this next chapter of my life, my professional and personal goals will be:

1. **Keep learning.** Bayesian modelling and deep learning for NLP, mostly.
2. **Open source.** I've been involved in both
   [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) and
   [PyMC4](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4). I hope to keep contributing!
3. **Photography.** My camera hasn't gotten the use it deserves. More photos to
   come!

My four years of college were enriching and rewarding, but I'm excited to enter
_the real world_. If you're based in New York and like data, math or coffee - or
even if you don't! - let's try our best to meet.
