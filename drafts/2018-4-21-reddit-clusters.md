I always knew that the interwebs were a wild place to be, but I didn't really
know just _how_ true that was until recently.

Reddit is posted online for free on Google. Like, _all_ of Reddit. Like, _free_.
Like, _online_ online. This stuff takes up _terabytes_ of storage. And you can
_download_ it.

Now to hedge that statement. It's not really on Google, but on a special Google
service called BigQuery. Ordinarily, you'd need to pay, but new users get a
1-year free trial, with $300 worth of credits. And there isn't just a big button
that says "DOWNLOAD", because you need to run a SQL query (you don't really want
to download 10 TB of Reddit, do you?)
