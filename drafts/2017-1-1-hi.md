Problems with neural nets:
1. no mathematical theory
2. very unsophisticated problem: just project to a ridiculously high dimensional
   space, and find good weights.
3. the rep and the fanbase: NNs and deep learning are the panacea to everything.

points 1 and 2 are easy to come to terms with: it works, and if you only care
about predictions (as most applications do), then it would be ridiculous to not
consider it another tool in your toolbox.
