This past semester I was lucky to be part of Data Science Projects for
Social Good, an interdisciplinary class led by Professors [Sam
Keene](https://ee.cooper.edu/~keene/) and [Will
Shapiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-shapiro-ba2477aa/) at The Cooper
Union. I worked with a team of amazingly talented artists, architects and
engineers to investigate hate speech on Reddit, and tell a powerful and
compelling story about it.

Although the scope of our project turned out to be so (_so_ _**so**_) much more
than just data science, I thought it'd be interesting to share some of the
results of the text clustering I did. Check out the Medium article I wrote!
