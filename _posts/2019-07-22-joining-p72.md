I'm happy to announce that today was my first day at [Point72 Asset
Management](https://www.point72.com/)! I'll be working as a data
scientist/research analyst, powering their internal research efforts (of course,
with a keen eye towards Bayesian methods :smile:).

In this next chapter of my life, my professional and personal goals will be:

1. **Keep learning.** Bayesian modelling and deep learning for NLP, mostly.
2. **Open source.** I've been involved in both
   [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) and
   [PyMC4](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4). I hope to keep contributing!
3. **Photography.** My camera hasn't gotten the use it deserves. More photos to
   come!

My four years of college were enriching and rewarding, but I'm excited to enter
_the real world_. I'm still based in New York, so if you live here and like
data, math or coffee — or even if you don't! — let's try to meet!
