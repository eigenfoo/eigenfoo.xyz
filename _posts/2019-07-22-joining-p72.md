Some exciting personal news: I'm joining [Point72 Asset
Management](https://www.point72.com/) as a data scientist/research analyst! I'll
be working out of their New York office, powering their internal research
efforts (of course, with an eye towards Bayesian methods :smile:).

In this next chapter of my life, my professional and personal goals are:

1. **Keep learning.** Bayesian methods and deep learning, mostly.
2. **Open source.** I've been involved in both maintaining
   [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) and developing
   [PyMC4](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4). I hope to keep contributing!
3. **Photography.** My camera hasn't gotten the love it deserves. More photos to
   come!

My four years of [undergraduate study](http://cooper.edu/welcome) were
incredibly enriching, but I'm excited to enter _the real world_. Stay tuned!
