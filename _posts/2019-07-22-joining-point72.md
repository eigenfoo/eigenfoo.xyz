Some exciting personal news: I've graduated from [The Cooper
Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome), and am joining [Point72 Asset
Management](https://www.point72.com/) as a data scientist/research analyst!

Point72 is a leading American hedge fund, headquartered in Connecticut. I'll be
based in New York City, working out of their [Hudson
Yards](https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/work/55-hudson-yards) offices.

In this next chapter of my life, my professional and personal focuses are:

1. **Keep learning.** Bayesian methods and deep learning, mostly.
1. **Open source.** I've been involved in both maintaining
   [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) and developing
   [PyMC4](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4). I hope to keep contributing!
1. **Photography and cardistry.** Those are my two current hobbies â€” I want to
   spend more time practicing and really get good at them!

My four years of college were incredibly rewarding, but I'm excited to enter the
real world. Stay tuned!
