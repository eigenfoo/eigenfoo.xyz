Hi there, my name is George!

Math nerd ([or geek](http://gizmodo.com/5528552/this-is-why-im-not-a-dork)),
coffee lover, incorrigible
[Pythonista](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-exact-difference-between-a-Pythoneer-and-a-Pythonista),
~~outstanding~~ card player and PyData enthusiast.

(_In case you haven't noticed, I also really like sushi._)

Check out [my blog](https://eigenfoo.github.io/blog/), read about some of [my
projects](https://eigenfoo.github.io/projects/), or find out more [about
me](https://eigenfoo.github.io/about/)!

## What's up with your username?

It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now people keep asking about it...

_Eigen_ is German for "own", but a better translation (especially when it comes
to math words like eigenvalue) would be "belonging to" or "corresponding to"
(e.g., a value _corresponding to_ a matrix). _Foo_, _bar_ and _baz_ are
[placeholder names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar) in computer
programming: basically techier versions of "asdf" or "blah".

So taken together, eigenfoo probably means something like "blahs that
belong to [George]".
