## Projects

Here are some of the more interesting machine learning and data science projects
I've pursued.

### [Hate Speech on Reddit](https://eigenfoo.xyz/reddit-clusters/)

As part of a project on [Data Science for Social
Good](http://ee.cooper.edu/~keene/dssg.html), I ran text clustering algorithms
on well-known hateful and toxic subreddits, and collaborated with a
cross-disciplinary team of artists, architects and engineers to present the
findings at [The Cooper Union 2018 End of Year
Show](https://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/2018-student-exhibition).
I also wrote [a blog post on my results](https://eigenfoo.xyz/reddit-clusters/),
and [gave a talk on the data science that went into the
project](https://eigenfoo.xyz/reddit-slides/).

## Software

Here are some open source software libraries that I contribute to regularly.

### [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3)

PyMC3 is a popular Python framework for Bayesian modeling and probabilistic
machine learning, focusing on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational
inference (VI) algorithms. I'm a member of the core development team, and
contribute to the PyMC3 internals and documentation. I wrote [a blog post on
tips and tricks for Bayesian modelling using
PyMC3](https://eigenfoo.xyz/bayesian-modelling-cookbook/).

### [Pyfolio](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio)

Pyfolio is a Python library for analyzing the performance and risk of financial
portfolios. It is integrated into the [Quantopian
platform](http://quantopian.com/). I developed the risk and performance
attribution capabilities of pyfolio: read more on [my blog post
here](https://eigenfoo.xyz/pyfolio/).

### [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens)

Alphalens is a Python library for analyzing the performance of predictive alpha
factors for algorithmic trading. It is integrated into the [Quantopian
platform](http://quantopian.com/). I help develop new features and troubleshoot
issues.
