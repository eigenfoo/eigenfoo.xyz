Hello! My name is George, and this is my personal website. I'm a data scientist,
machine learner, dabbling mathematician and coffee ~~addict~~ lover. (I also really
like sushi.)

I'm currently a data scientist/ research analyst at [Point72 Asset
Management](http://point72.com), working out of their New York office. I help
power their internal research efforts, with a particular penchant for Bayesian
modelling and data analysis.

Previously, I studied engineering at [The Cooper
Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New York, and interned at
[Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) in Boston.

## What's with your username/handle?

It seemed like a clever pun at the time... but people keep asking, so maybe not.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for
math terms like
[eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)) would
be _belonging to_. For example, an eigenvalue is the value _belonging to_ a
matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier
version of "stuff" or "thing".

So taken together, `eigenfoo` probably means something like "things
belonging to [George]".
