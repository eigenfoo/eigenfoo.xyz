![Me, happy with sushi]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/portrait.png){: .align-right}

Hello! My name is George, and this is my personal website and blog. I'm a data
scientist, machine learner, dabbling mathematician and coffee ~~addict~~ lover.
(I also really like sushi.)

I'm based in New York and I work as a data scientist/ research analyst at
[Point72 Asset Management](http://point72.com), where I help power the alpha
capture business and internal research efforts.

Outside of work, I contribute to and maintain [several other open-source
libraries](https://eigenfoo.xyz/work/#software) (particularly the [PyMC
projects](https://github.com/pymc-devs)). Away from the keyboard, I spend my
time pursuing cardistry and photography. Oh, and coffee drinking.

Previously, I studied engineering at [The Cooper
Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) with minors in computer science and
mathematics, and I interned at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) on
their quant research and data science teams, where I researched models and
developed open-source software for the algorithmic hedge fund.

## What's with your username/handle?

It seemed like a clever pun at the time... but people keep asking, so maybe not.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for
math terms like
[eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)) would
be _belonging to_. For example, an eigenvalue is the value _belonging to_ a
matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier
version of "stuff" or "thing".

So taken together, `eigenfoo` probably means something like "things
belonging to [George]".
