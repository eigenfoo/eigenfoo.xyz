Hi there, my name is George, and this is my personal website!

I'm currently a junior at [The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science
and Art](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New York, studying for a BSE in
General Engineering.

I'm interested in mathematics, computation and data, and especiallly anything
that brings them together.

## What's with your username?

It seemed like a clever idea at the time... but now people keep asking.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for
mathematical terms like
[eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)) would
be _corresponding to_, or _characteristic of_. For example, an eigenvalue is the
value _corresponding to_ a matrix, or _characteristic of_ a matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier
version of "blah" or "thing".

So taken together, `eigenfoo` probably means something like "things
corresponding to [George]".
