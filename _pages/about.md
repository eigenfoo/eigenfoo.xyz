Hi there, my name is George!

I'm currently a junior at [The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science
and Art](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New York, studying for a BSE in
General Engineering. Prior to The Cooper Union, I attended the
[Chinese International School](https://www.cis.edu.hk/) in Hong Kong, where 
I studied for the International Baccalaureate (IB).

I'm interested in mathematics, computation and data, and especiallly anything
that brings them together (bonus points if they're applied to do cool things!)
That's the most faithful description of my passions that I could come up with,
but I may as well pigeonhole myself and say _"I'm passionate about data science
and machine learning"_.

This website is to document my thoughts and opinions as continue to [get pushed
inexorably forward through time](https://xkcd.com/1524/).
