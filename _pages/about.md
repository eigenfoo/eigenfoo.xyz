Hi there, my name is George!

I'm currently a junior at [The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science
and Art](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New York, studying for a BSE in
General Engineering. Prior to The Cooper Union, I attended the
[Chinese International School](https://www.cis.edu.hk/) in Hong Kong, where 
I studied for the International Baccalaureate (IB).

I'm interested in anything that brings mathematics, computation and data
together to do cool things. So that means things like quantitative finance,
machine learning and data science.

I'm still a newcomer to all this, so there's still a veritable horseload of
stuff for me to learn: this website is just to document my thoughts along the
way.
