Hello! My name is George, and this is my personal website. I'm a PyData
ninja, machine learner, math enthusiast and coffee ~~addict~~ lover. (I also
really like sushi.)

I'm currently a senior at [The Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New
York, studying for a BSE in general engineering. I'm also a two-time
quantitative research and data science intern at
[Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) in Boston, where I helped power
research analytics and open-source software for the algorithmic hedge fund.

## What's with your username/handle?

It seemed like a clever pun at the time... but people keep asking, so maybe not.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for
math terms like
[eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)) would
be _belonging to_. For example, an eigenvalue is the value _belonging to_ a
matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier
version of "stuff" or "thing".

So taken together, `eigenfoo` probably means something like "things
belonging to [George]".
