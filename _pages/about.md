![Me, happy with sushi]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/portrait.png){: .align-right}

Hello! My name is George, and this is my personal website and blog. I'm a data
scientist, machine learner, math enthusiast and coffee ~~addict~~ lover. (I also
really like sushi.)

Previously, I studied engineering, computer science and mathematics at [The
Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New York. For two summers, I
interned with the quant research and data science team at
[Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) in Boston, where I researched models
and develop open-source software for the algorithmic hedge fund.

## What's with your username/handle?

It seemed like a clever pun at the time... but people keep asking, so maybe not.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for
math terms like
[eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)) would
be _belonging to_. For example, an eigenvalue is the value _belonging to_ a
matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier
version of "stuff" or "thing".

So taken together, `eigenfoo` probably means something like "things
belonging to [George]".
