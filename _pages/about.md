Hi there, my name is George!

I'm currently a junior at [The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science
and Art](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New York, studying for a BSE in
General Engineering. Prior to The Cooper Union, I attended the
[Chinese International School](https://www.cis.edu.hk/) in Hong Kong, where 
I studied for the International Baccalaureate (IB).

I'm interested in anything that brings mathematics, computation and data
together to do cool things. I'm still not entirely sure what that really means,
but things like machine learning and data science interest me (I mean, that's a
pretty vacuous statement since almost everyone in STEM is interested in those
things nowadays).

I'm still a newcomer to all this, so there's still a _lot_ stuff for me to
learn: this website is just to document my thoughts along the way.
