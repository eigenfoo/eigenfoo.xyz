Hi there, my name is George, and this is my personal blog.

I'm currently a junior at [The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science
and Art](http://cooper.edu/welcome) in New York, studying for a BSE in
General Engineering. Prior to The Cooper Union, I attended the
[Chinese International School](https://www.cis.edu.hk/) in Hong Kong, where 
I studied for the International Baccalaureate (IB).

I'm interested in mathematics, computation and data, and especiallly anything
that brings them together (bonus points if they're applied to do cool things!)
That's the best description of my interests that I could come up with, but I may
as well pigeonhole myself and say _"I'm passionate about data science and
machine learning"_.
