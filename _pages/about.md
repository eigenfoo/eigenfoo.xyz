Hello! My name is George, and this is my personal website. I'm a data scientist,
machine learner, dabbling mathematician and coffee ~~addict~~ lover. (I also really
like sushi.)

I'm currently a data scientist/ research analyst at [Point72 Asset Management,
L.P.](http://point72.com), where I help power the alpha capture business and
internal research efforts. I'm based in New York and work out of Point72's
[Hudson Yards office](https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/work/55-hudson-yards).

Outside of work, I contribute to and maintain the PyMC project (particularly
[PyMC4](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4)).

Previously, I studied engineering at [The Cooper
Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) with minors in computer science and
mathematics, and interned at [Quantopian, Inc.](https://www.quantopian.com/) on
the quantitative research/data science team.

## What's with your username/handle?

It seemed like a clever pun at the time... but people keep asking, so maybe not.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for
math terms like
[eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)) would
be _belonging to_. For example, an eigenvalue is the value _belonging to_ a
matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier
version of "stuff" or "thing".

So taken together, `eigenfoo` probably means something like "things
belonging to [George]".
