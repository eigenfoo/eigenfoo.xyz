Hello! My name is George.

I'm based in New York and I work for [Point72 Asset
Management](http://point72.com) as a data scientist/research analyst.

Outside of work, I contribute to and maintain [several open-source
libraries](https://eigenfoo.xyz/work/#software) (particularly the [PyMC
project](https://github.com/pymc-devs)). Away from the keyboard, I spend my time
pursuing cardistry and photography. Oh, and drinking coffee :coffee: :coffee:.

Previously, I studied engineering at [The Cooper
Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) with minors in computer science and
mathematics, and I interned at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) on
their quant research and data science teams.

## What's with your username/handle?

It seemed like a clever pun at the time... but people keep asking, so maybe not.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for
math terms like
[eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)) would
be _belonging to_. For example, an eigenvalue is the value _belonging to_ a
matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier
version of "stuff" or "thing".

So taken together, `eigenfoo` probably means something like "things
belonging to [George]".
